Deep learning architectures for segmentation are crucial in computer vision, enabling precise delineation of objects within images. Here’s a list of notable architectures tailored for segmentation tasks:

## Architectures for Image Segmentation

### U-Net
- Originally designed for biomedical image segmentation, U-Net features a symmetric architecture consisting of a contracting path (encoder) and an expansive path (decoder). The encoder captures context, while the decoder enables precise localization.
  
### Mask R-CNN
- An extension of Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN adds a branch for predicting segmentation masks on each Region of Interest (RoI). It simultaneously performs object detection and pixel-wise segmentation.

### DeepLab
- DeepLab employs atrous convolution to capture multi-scale context by using dilated convolutions. This architecture is effective for semantic segmentation, allowing for better edge detection and context understanding.

### Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN)
- FCNs replace fully connected layers with convolutional layers, allowing the network to output segmentation maps of the same size as the input image. They are foundational in segmentation tasks.

### Gated-SCNN
- This architecture integrates a two-stream CNN where one stream captures shape information and the other processes boundary information, enhancing segmentation accuracy.

### SegNet
- SegNet consists of an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder captures features and the decoder upsamples them to create the final segmentation map. It is known for its simplicity and effectiveness.

### PSPNet (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network)
- PSPNet employs a pyramid pooling module to capture global context information at different scales, improving segmentation performance in complex scenes.

### HRNet (High-Resolution Network)
- HRNet maintains high-resolution representations through the entire network, allowing it to capture fine details necessary for accurate segmentation.
